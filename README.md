# Data Structures and Algorithms Projects

## Mini-Router 

Router dataplane written in C that implements ARP, ICMP and IP protocols which uses a routing algorithm based on longest prefix match strategy using a Trie tree data structure.

## Mini-Vim

Vim-like editor coded in C with support for commands like undo, redo, delete line/word/all, goto line, replace, save.

## Algo-Assembly

Series of algorithms and data structures written in assembly language: sorting nodes of a list algorithm, a stack machine implementation, arithmetic expression evaluation, retrieving CPU details using cpuid instruction, etc.

## Game-Tree

Optimal strategy algorithm for Tic-Tac-Toe that plays a perfect game using concepts from game theory such as and-or-tree, game tree, and minimax algorithm.

## Competitive-Algo

Graph, data structures, and miscellaneous templates used in solving competitive programming related tasks.
